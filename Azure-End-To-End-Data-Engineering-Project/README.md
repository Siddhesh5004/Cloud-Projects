## OLYMPIC DATA ANALYSIS THROUGH AZURE CLOUD SERVICES

# Azure Data Engineering Process

The Azure Data Engineering process consists of various steps that enable the transformation and display of data from a data source.

## Azure Data Engineering process based on the architecture diagram:

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - **Step**: Extract data from the data source.
   - **Process**: The data ingestion layer is responsible for gathering data from various sources. This step may include batch processing or real-time streaming to move data into a centralized storage location.

2. **Data Storage**
   - **Step**: Store the ingested data.
   - **Process**: The raw data is stored in a data lake. This allows the data to be kept in its original format, ready for further processing and transformation.

3. **Data Transformation**
   - **Step**: Cleanse, aggregate, and prepare data.
   - **Process**: The data transformation step involves processing the raw data to make it suitable for analysis. This includes cleansing to remove inaccuracies, aggregating data for summary statistics, and applying business logic to enhance data quality.

4. **Data Storage (Transformed)**
   - **Step**: Store the transformed data.
   - **Process**: After transformation, the data is stored again in a refined state, making it easier to query and analyze.

5. **Analytics**
   - **Step**: Analyze and model data.
   - **Process**: Analytical processing is applied to the transformed data to extract insights. This may involve running complex queries, creating predictive models, or performing statistical analysis.

6. **Visualization and Reporting**
   - **Step**: Display the analyzed data.
   - **Process**: The final step involves presenting the data through interactive dashboards and reports. This allows users to visualize trends, patterns, and insights, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

Throughout the process, data flows from raw extraction to insightful presentation, ensuring it is managed effectively and efficiently at each step.
